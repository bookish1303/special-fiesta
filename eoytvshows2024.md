# New TV of 2024, briefly

It's about that time of year to reflect on the TV shows of the past 12 months and figure out what was good, what was bad, and what was...whatever it was. It's too late to meaningfully digest any more TV before the end of the year (I'll spend it probably burning off Christmas films and rewatching 90s Star Trek episodes or whatever...*shudders* "old" TV from the 90s and 2000s will be comforting and non-anxiety inducing. But in the meanwhile, here's a list of new TV that I thought was halfway decent, along with some mention of TV shows that I guess I should have already watched, but which go into the To Watch pile until I get around to it.

## Criteria
I watch television in two ways: "appointment TV," which is usually premium TV I need to give full attention to, and "ambient TV," where I'm doing something else while I watch and go in and out as required. I'm not separating the two categories here, but the influence of both probably reflects in my interests in procedurals, often with quirky detective-types, superheroes and science fiction. I tend to prefer drama over comedy, and scripted over reality. I am aware of various problematic issues surrounding certain shows and their creators, but am trying to not let them influence whether shows make "the list" or not. This isn't an exhaustive list, and I'm looking for TV shows that are doing something interesting, however I would define it. I certainly haven't watched everything, and even missed some big ticket shows, which is why this year I have a wishlist of shows at the end.

## General Observations
It feels to me like 2024 has been the year of a mini renaissance in network TV. There are far fewer hours for the networks to have to program now due to conceding viewers, ad money and most of the industry streamers. It also feels like the dual writers and actors strikes may have had a quantifiable effect in some cases. But overall, it feels like after losing ground to streamers over the last few years, producers at the main networks are making a reasonable case for longer-season lower-budget four quadrant television as a place for experimentation across the board with the genres and tropes that network TV itself popularized. On the streamer side, it feels like Netflix continues to churn mediocre television, with the occasional flash of something interesting. Hulu (in some cases FX on Hulu) seems to be making consistently decent television, even if, like AppleTV+, it is critically successful television that may not necessariily find an audience. Disney+ is the only other prominent streamer that seems to have had a good year in my books, mainly in franchise fare. The remaining streamers each seem to have interesting things going on, but no consistent signs of quality, to me at least. My attention has been spread all around.

## The List
### 3 Body Problem (Netflix)
International adaptation of the Chinese novel which, I'm ashamed to say, makes the novels and their initial two adaptations easier to understand for the Western viewer. I understand the appeal of the source material to Benioff and Weiss, and this first season certainly started off strong with interestng sci-fi concepts mixed with sociopolitical issues. The question is whether or not the show can continue to be interesting without being plagued by Benioff and Weiss's own foibles when they try to fill in source material with their own original work.

### The Acolyte (Disney+)
I'm never into Star Wars the way I feel like I should be. But this show seemed to play with some interesting concepts, fleshed out the dark side a bit, and had a notably diverse cast that mad the show worth at least one watch. I was not into Andor, but this show seemed to strike a balance between compelling tv, playing with Star Wars lore in a way that expanded the concept, and appealing to new audiences. I don't need another season, but it's a shame that the show isn't getting one.

### Agatha All Along (Disney+)
Much like The Acolyte, this is here more to represent the best that Marvel can do at this moment. It makes sense to do a follow-up to Wandavision as one of the more succcesful Marvel shows and this is pretty much the only way to make that happen given the status of Wanda in the MCU. It was fun and whimsical, with bouts of seriousness and, of course, Patti Lupone. I hope this one gets renewed somehow, but I also can't pretend that, despite some solid episodes, this show needed to exist or has anything to say about itself or whatever is going on with Marvel right now.

### Batman: Caped Crusader (Amazon Prime)
I am happy this got to see the light of day. Making essentially an extended homage to the animated series with a new setup but much of the art style and thematic work that made that series popular made for a nostalgic series that is a much-needed balm to the diminishing quality of the DC Animated Universe. Reception seems to have died down for this one, but truly another strong adaptation of the character.

### Brilliant Minds (NBC)
A brilliant doctor with something off joins a hospital and saves lives in weird ways. The cases are somewhat interesting but these types of procedurals always take a backseat to the soap opera of doctors' personal lives. It means something to have Zachary Quinto play a gay doctor and have a relationship with another man that doesn't call attention to the non-heteronormative nature of that relationship, and to have it play subtly in the background of multiple episodes.

### The Day of the Jackal (Peacock)
Anything with Eddie Redmayne is a joy to watch, primarily because the man's default state seems to be visibly suffering in silence. While the show makes me question whether The Jackal knows what he's doing at all, where the show demonstrates its chic and smooth operations, it is truly a pleasure to watch.
